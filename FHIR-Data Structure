#Every FHIR resource is composed of a collection of predefined data types. 
You can’t create whatever you want to create.
FHIR constraints working within an existing set of data types — some simple, some complex. 

#Most data types fall into the ‘Primitive’ or ‘General Purpose’ categories.

Some Primitive data types:

- date
- string
- boolean
- url

‘General Purpose’ data types are bigger and store more complex pieces of data. They tend to be small objects that are useful across a wide range of resources and elements.

- Ratio
- HumanName
- Address
- Coding

These different data types are the building blocks of the various FHIR resources and elements. 


Every data type — even the Primitives like string and boolean — can contain Extensions. An Extension can be composed of almost any data type — even the more complex ‘General Purpose’ ones.

This is by design.
